# Variational-Auto-Encoders
* This repository contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model for anomaly detection, specifically for credit card fraud detection. 
* It was developed as part of my M.Sc. Computer Science dissertation. 
* While this implementation is niche, it demonstrates how generative models like VAEs can be applied to anomaly detection.
* This project is intended solely for academic purposes, exploring the potential of VAEs in fraud detection and anomaly identification.

# Tech Stack
* Python (Programming Langauge) 
* TensorFlow (Framework)
* PyTorch (Framework)

# Note Books
* TensorFlow Implementation: The original VAE model was implemented using TensorFlow.
* PyTorch Implementation: A new notebook has been added, featuring the same model reimplemented in PyTorch.
